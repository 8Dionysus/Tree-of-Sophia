# Native access response budgets

`AccessProfile::max_response_bytes` limits the raw query packet shared by CLI,
HTTP and MCP. MCP tool results contain that packet as both escaped JSON text
and raw `structuredContent`; the JSON-RPC envelope, encoded request ID and
newline add transport bytes. Raw packet admission therefore does not imply
MCP frame admission.

`AccessProfile::new(request, response, line)` preserves the existing default:
its MCP tool-result frame cap equals the raw response cap. A legal packet whose
complete frame exceeds that cap receives JSON-RPC error `-32603`,
`MCP response frame exceeds byte budget`, without packet disclosure. Exact
escaped frame length is checked before constructing the duplicated carrier.
CLI and HTTP packet limits are unchanged.

A caller can explicitly select a separate frame allowance with
`with_mcp_frame_budget`. `mcp::tool_result_frame_byte_bound` derives a
conservative finite allowance from declared packet and request byte caps,
including worst-case JSON escaping of packet text and canonical request ID,
the structured copy, fixed envelope and newline. It returns `None` on arithmetic
overflow. Pass the smaller of request and line caps for the request bound. This
helper selects no production policy; the native binary keeps its existing
1 MiB packet and frame caps and remains without a public owner binding.

The maintained selected-wire fixture explicitly uses this derived allowance
so every packet within its declared packet cap can traverse MCP. Its parser
uses the same frame cap, and its assertions retain exact CLI, HTTP, MCP text
and structured packet bytes plus the selected lease through final flush.
The existing framing refusal case continues to check the default equal caps.
Cancellation and current-authority disclosure fences apply independently of
these byte allowances.

The selected-family wire case also reuses the maintained native producer
fixture for temporal, lens compile, focus, stored lens and exploration replay.
It derives route selectors from the native descriptor and stored LensSpec from
the digest-bound selected catalog. The fixture authority is still a test-only
current-binding model, never an issuer or public grant. Native HTTP
`write_response` is shared by the socket path and supplied writers; its final
fence precedes bytes and its hold lasts through flush. Selected family cases
observe that hold and refuse withdrawal/cancellation before disclosure. Public
session issuance and Worker Response/body delivery require their own owners.
