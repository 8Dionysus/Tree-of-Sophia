# Branch Growth Cycle

## Operating Card

| Field | Route |
| --- | --- |
| role | distinguish deepen-node, create-node, and form-branch moves |
| input | source pressure, review state, branch need |
| output | growth route or return-to-review |
| owner | `mechanics/growth-cycle/parts/branch-growth-cycle/` |
| next route | `ToS/philosophy/` or `ToS/canon/` after review |
| tools | `mechanics/growth-cycle/parts/branch-growth-cycle/docs/GROWTH_STRUCTURE.md`, `ToS/philosophy/philosophy.manifest.json`, `mechanics/growth-cycle/parts/branch-growth-cycle/scripts/knowledge_assessment.py` |
| check | `python scripts/validate_philosophy_topology.py` |

## Assessment policy application

`scripts/knowledge_assessment.py` applies the source-owned
`ToS/doctrine/KNOWLEDGE_ASSESSMENT.md` law to authenticated owner inputs without
network, model calls or source writes. It distinguishes substantive assessment
from current admission. The caller supplies trusted policy, grants, competence,
current exact records and complete bounded subject history; submitted prose
cannot provide its own authority. This pure engine is not a command
adapter or proof of agent competence. Local invariant checks belong to
`mechanics/growth-cycle/tests/test_knowledge_assessment.py` and the existing
`mechanics_local` discovery lane.

## Source-owner journal

`scripts/assessment_journal.py` implements immutable source-owned assessment
batches and an atomic per-subject head pointer under an explicitly configured
owner directory. `ToS/contracts/knowledge-assessment-batch.schema.json` owns
their shape. The parent directory must already exist. A hash partitions storage;
it does not replace the subject's ToS ID. No corpus assertions are copied into
a second database. Original assessment rationale and refs remain in the owned
batches; derived current admission can be rebuilt.

`append(engine, context, reviews, command_id=..., expected_revision=..., now=...)`
requires authenticated bindings and an agreed source snapshot from the command
owner. It records a valid assessment even when the judgment rejects, disputes
or defers use. It rejects the entire new batch on qualification failure or a
stale expected head. Replaying the exact command returns its old receipt and
fresh current admission separately. `inspect` materializes one subject's
complete committed history; it is not a corpus-wide scan or a public endpoint.

Unix locking serializes writers with a bounded wait (five seconds by default);
`JournalBusy` means retry, not discard or restart the live writer. Immutable blobs are fsynced before atomic head
publication; interrupted unreferenced blobs are not active history and are not
silently deleted. Missing/corrupt committed data fails closed. Committed
supersession stays effective even after the old grant expires or is revoked.
Tests cover these mechanics with synthetic records, not OS power-loss hardware
proof, trusted runtime identity, semantic quality or a deployed growth API.

Materialization currently bounds one history at 1,024 assessment events and
each batch at 1 MiB; it refuses truncation. Larger histories need a source-owned
checkpoint/archive reader, not deletion of history. Orphan retention, actual
corpus-adapter binding, cross-object transactions and research/UI integration
remain foundation work; this journal alone does not close the Growth profile.

### Local account command contract

The journal also offers `run_local_command(owner_config, request)` and a CLI:

```bash
python mechanics/growth-cycle/parts/branch-growth-cycle/scripts/assessment_journal.py \
  --owner-config /absolute/operator-selected/owner.json < request.json
```

This is an explicit local owner operation, never part of read-only `access`.
The operator/command issuer selects the configuration independently of incoming
requests. It must contain already authorized policy, grants, calibrated
competence, source scope and an execution profile whose provenance the issuer
has checked. The command does not create these records or approve its own model.
Unix UID authenticates an account, **not** a model invocation or competence.
Processes sharing that UID share this trust boundary; use a separately owned
runtime adapter for mutually untrusted agents or remote callers.

The configuration is one bounded (8 MiB) agreed source snapshot, not a second
authoritative corpus. It has exactly these fields:

| Field | Owner value |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | `tos_local_assessment_owner_v1` |
| `uid`, `principal_id` | actual local account UID and its delegated reviewer identity |
| `execution_profile` | exact current `{id, version, digest}`; independent of assessment prose |
| `policy` | one record envelope |
| `authorities`, `competencies`, `records` | bounded lists of current record envelopes (at most 1,024 each) |
| `subjects` | at most 1,024 IDs mapped to trusted scopes |
| `journal_directory` | an existing, dedicated absolute owner directory |

A record envelope is `{id, version, payload, origin_id}` (null origin is allowed
where independent-source support is not claimed). A subject scope is exactly
`{record, assertion_layer, risk, languages, maker_id, requested_use, access_allowed}`;
`record` is its exact ref. Unknown source fields are retained inside `payload`,
not interpreted as commands. Publish an updated configuration atomically when
source, permissions, policy or calibration changes. Each command samples it
once; configuration publishers must preserve the agreed snapshot during the
operation. This is not a cross-file transaction with a concurrently edited
corpus. A subsequent call loads current configuration and rechecks admission.

The `inspect` and `append` request operations use `schema_version: tos_local_assessment_command_v1`,
`operation` (`append` or `inspect`), `subject_id`, `expected_subject` (exact ref)
and `expected_snapshot` (`sha256:` plus canonical-JSON configuration digest).
`append` additionally requires `command_id`, `expected_revision` (null for an
empty journal, otherwise its 64-character head hash) and `assessments` (raw
assessment objects, not caller-supplied authenticated submissions). No other
request fields are accepted. There is no submitted UID, clock, grant, risk,
configuration path, shell command or execution binding. The issuer provides
the snapshot reference to callers; request code never chooses its own trust root.

The CLI accepts at most 1 MiB of JSON on stdin, refuses duplicate keys and
nonfinite numbers, and never executes source instructions. Protected owner
paths must have no symlinks and no group/other write permissions; root-owned
sticky ancestors are allowed, but not as the final owner directory. Setuid
execution is refused. Owner directory contents must remain protected from
untrusted same-account processes; filesystem ownership is not a sandbox.
The local entrypoint also checks each accessed journal descendant; new subject
directories and locks are private even under a permissive process umask.

Success exits 0 with `tos_local_assessment_result_v1`, the owner snapshot,
`authentication: local-unix-account` and the journal `result`. A commit can
record rejection/defer/dispute without admitting the assertion. An exact replay
returns the historical receipt and **fresh** current admission separately.
Errors exit 2 with `tos_local_assessment_error_v1` and a nonreflective exception
class (`JournalConflict`, `AssessmentRejected`, `JournalBusy`, `PermissionError`,
etc.); source/configuration text is not echoed. Conflicts require rereading
current state; busy writers require retry, never deleting their journal.

`describe` takes exactly `{schema_version, operation, subject_id}` and returns
the current owner snapshot, subject and policy refs, trusted scope, journal
revision and freshly checked admission in `result.command_context` and the
usual journal result. `supported_operations` describes command grammar, not
authorization (`grants_authority: false`). A caller can use those exact refs
to construct `inspect` or `append`; it need not calculate the owner's snapshot
or guess file/JSON selectors. Read operations need no configured execution
profile: null is valid until an actual qualified writer binding exists.
`append` still requires the independent current execution profile and grants.

### Source-bound configuration v2

`tos_local_assessment_owner_v2` retains the v1 fields and adds `source_root`
(protected absolute repository root) and `source_records` (at most 1,024
distinct `{path, record_id, origin_id}` bindings). Only explicit JSON/JSONL
metadata files under `ToS/source-witnesses/` are read; payload/local-content
paths, escapes and symlinks are refused. No directory discovery, network,
OCR, global graph build or source write runs. The total source-file read
budget is 8 MiB, each file selects at most 1,024 records, and inline plus
source-selected records share the existing 1,024-record snapshot bound.

The adapter understands the identity/version envelopes of corpus-record v1,
claim-packet v1 and human-form v1. A JSONL record is selected by stable ID,
not line number; a human-form set selects only its current `forms`, never
`prior_forms`. Duplicate current IDs or selected bindings are errors. Source
payload fields, including unknown extensions and historical review fields,
retain the same JSON values without semantic promotion. Unknown
identity families cannot be selected through this adapter and remain in the
original source with an explicit unsupported-family error. The adapter is not
a replacement for the corresponding source validator or full corpus mapping.

Claims must explicitly allow `public` or `public_metadata_only` visibility;
other or missing visibility requires a separately authorized adapter. A
source-bound claim's maker and assertion layer must agree with the configured
scope; a form binds its creator and the `human_projection` layer. Risk, use,
access and calibrated languages still belong to the trusted issuer. Inline
copies cannot shadow source-bound IDs. An origin ID is issuer-owned provenance,
not manufactured from a file path or a count of copies.

The owner snapshot binds the configuration, each exact source-file byte digest
and every selected full record. In-read modification is refused. This does not
make independently changing source files transactional: the issuer must keep
the agreed multi-file snapshot stable during the operation. A source change
invalidates an old command snapshot; a subject change also requires updating
its owner scope. Canonical record refs remain distinct from file-byte fixity.
`describe` exposes selected record refs, source paths, file digests and declared
origins, not a second corpus body or permission to use the source text.

The integration test reads the real Jenseits Work, 1886 German Expression,
Work-to-Expression Claim and name form through this CLI, preserving empty
assessment history as `unreviewed`. Mutation/refusal checks use explicitly
temporary copies. This is real source/command integration, not a positive
historical, linguistic or calibration verdict.

Tests exercise the real CLI describe/inspect/error boundary and local command append,
replay, revocation, protected paths and adversarial requests with synthetic
review records. No real-language calibration or authenticated remote/model
execution is inferred from these checks.

## Human-form materialization

`scripts/human_forms.py` renders the source-owned
`ToS/doctrine/HUMAN_FORMS.md` contract. `materialize_form` takes an immutable
form record, trusted `FormScope`, exact access-filtered source records and an
owner-admitted template set. `SourceBinding` identifies a whole JSON field, not
an executable expression. Required context comes from the source owner, not
the proposed wording. Freeform rendering requires the existing assessment
engine and authenticated reviews/history against the current form and source
snapshot; it cannot use a submitted positive status as permission.

This pure operation writes nothing and does not call a model. The result's
wording and context are a single read contract; `standalone_reading: false`
forbids consuming the string as an unqualified assertion. The current output
budget is 64 KiB with explicit refusal, not semantic truncation. Missing,
restricted, stale and assessment-required states have no emitted wording.
Rendering mechanics do not prove an adapter's authentication, a template's
semantic quality, an agent's real-language competence or UI consumption.
`mechanics/growth-cycle/tests/test_human_forms.py` protects these boundaries.

Optional `FormScope.language_context` names exact source-owned language and
linguistic-derivation metadata. The form must bind the same object and any
translation/transliteration/adaptation source field. Both remain current
dependencies and mandatory context; source-copy is not a declaration of
originality. These checks preserve the source owner's declaration without
performing linguistic assessment or granting a submission its own scope.
