# Semantic interchange registry

This directory owns the stable machine vocabulary used when ToS material is
composed into read-only knowledge lenses. It is an interchange layer over
source-owned meaning, not a universal ontology and not a route into canon.

## Identity and vocabulary

`entity-types.v1.json` gives durable `tos.entity.*` IDs to reusable entity
families. `relation-types.v1.json` gives durable `tos.relation.*` IDs to
relation families and declares their domain, range, directionality,
cardinality posture, evidence posture, and review requirement. Every mapping
also retains the exact source-native `kind_id` or `predicate_id`; the stable
family never erases the authored subtype.

Source mappings may carry localized `labels` for the exact native kind or
predicate. These labels override the family label for display only; explicit
instance display remains stronger. Registry version 3 carries the Russian
predicate vocabulary from `ToS/canon/registries/predicates.csv` verbatim into
both canon and candidate-intake mappings, and distinguishes the eight atlas
metadata kinds. This does not change source status, domain/range, identity or
review requirements. The source CSV remains the owner of its wording; the
access contract test checks crosswalk parity rather than accepting new meaning.

Unknown source vocabulary is represented by the explicit
`tos.entity.unmapped` or `tos.relation.unmapped` fallback. It must never be
silently coerced into the nearest familiar type. A new stable type is added by
extending the registry, declaring its owner and lifecycle, validating the
hierarchy and crosswalk, and bumping `registry_version` when a released
registry changes. Incompatible meaning receives a successor ID and an
explicit `supersedes_*` link rather than reusing an old ID.

## Semantic boundaries

- Agent is a persistent responsibility bearer. Author, translator, editor,
  designer, and other responsibilities are typed relations, not Agent
  subclasses or mutable role fields.
- Work, Expression, Edition, Item, File, and Link remain distinct. A Link is
  an observed access identity, not the object at its URI.
- Place is a persistent geographic identity. A source-navigation Region is a
  browsing partition and is explicitly not a Place.
- Event identity is separate from TemporalAssertion. Dates, intervals,
  precision, calendars, and publication stages remain source-returnable
  assertion values.
- Bibliographic and other evidence-bearing assertions use reified Claim
  topology: subject, predicate family, object, evidence, maker, provenance,
  review, version, and supersession stay inspectable.

Cross-layer predicates are intentionally narrow. `projects` connects carrier
representations that already declare the same persistent ToS ID. `grounded-in`
requires an exact declared source reference. `about` requires a source-owned
topical assertion. `represents` requires an explicit representation claim.
`same-as` is never inferred from names, paths, links, or similar text; it
requires evidence and accepted identity review.

## Projection law

The access backend may normalize, index, filter, traverse, and display these
types, but it must preserve complete public source payloads under the
normalized envelope, keep `source_refs`, expose mapping status, validate
domain and range, and report synthesized display prose as synthesis. Generated
graphs, D1 tables, catalogs, and LensResults are disposable read models. They
cannot accept source, rights, translation, semantic, identity, or canon
claims.

## Executable boundary and text spine

Registry version 2 rejects abstract instances, missing or cyclic supersession
targets, incompatible endpoint types and missing supporting Claim references.
A bibliographic Claim has exactly one subject and one object. Its literal
object does not inherit `claim_ref` as its identity. `same-as` requires resolved
exact-version review and evidence nodes, not an `accepted` string and a URL.
Multiple representations of one persistent ID remain separate; `projects` does
not discard a second representation in one source.

Property descriptors publish type, applicability, inheritance and operators.
`semantics.type_ancestors contains <type-id>` selects a type and descendants.
Comparable time bounds retain precision and declare calendar and year numbering.
Unknown dates/calendars do not gain invented order keys.

Public text-unit and semantic-annotation-v2 packets expose an addressable route
from Work through TextLayer, TextUnit/Anchor, Occurrence/Sign/Concept and Claim
to Evidence/Review. Competing interpretations remain separate. The projector
does not read private text; metadata-only packets omit lexical hashes and
declare content availability. A private lexical workbench is not automatically
a public or accepted annotation layer.

Missing reviews, unresolved source endpoints and synthesized descriptions remain
visible gaps. Broad legacy relation families retain native predicates; mapping
coverage does not prove their philosophical endpoint semantics. Tightening such
source assertions requires source-visible review, not inference from labels.
